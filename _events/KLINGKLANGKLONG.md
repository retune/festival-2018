intro: |
  The installation »GORILLAS« turns Silent Green’s courtyard, the entrance to the old crematory, into a living ecosystem of sound objects. Together, the objects create an evolving soundscape where light, fog and sound come together as a narrative environment. The audience can interact with the objects, close/mute or move them in space. In a cooperation with Martine-Nicole Rojina's »Moon Bounce« the installation will feature voices that were recorded and sent to the moon and back.

  Don't miss out when the clock strikes 20:15 as the installation will then move into an elevated interactive performance once the sun goes down and the atmosphere of the space transforms. 

outro: |
  kling klang klong is a creative studio for sound, music and acoustic narratives based in Berlin. Our work stands in the intersection between art, science and communication. As a result, our projects create new pioneering approaches to communicate with audiences through exhibition spaces, motion pictures, interactive installations, performances and public spaces.

  Martine-Nicole Rojina / MPATHY STUDIO collaborated with KLING KLANG KLONG by sharing the recorded phrases of her project Phrases Moon Bounce, sent by different people from different backgrounds. These messages were sent to the moon and received back in collaboration with the Dwingeloo Radio Telescope, HAM Radio Astronomers Jan van Muijlwijk, Harry Keizer and the artistic residency program of CAMRAS. Some of these voices where sent to the moon from a decommissioned Nuclear Reactor during the Music Tech Stockholm 2018.

  Collaborators: Annelie Andre, Felipe Duarte Cely, David Fallenbacher, Julien Herion, David Roif
