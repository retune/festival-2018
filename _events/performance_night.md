intro: |
  Join the Retune Festival 2018 on the evening of September 27th for the amazing performance night. The site-specific sound installation "Gorillas" by kling klang klong will be premiered at silent green Kulturquartier.

  GORILLAS turns Silent Green’s courtyard, the entrance to the old crematory, into a living ecosystem of sound objects. Together, the objects create an evolving soundscape where light, fog and sound come together as a narrative environment. The audience can interact with the objects, close / mute them or move them in space.

  Following this, Rainer Kohlberger will invite for some immersiveness, with an A/V performance of noise, drones and stroboscopic lights, that unfolds a sense of the infinite. We will finish the evening with a drink, or two at the bar.

  [KLING KLANG KLONG](http://www.klingklangklong.com) is a creative studio for sound, music and acoustic narratives based in Berlin. Our work stands in the intersection between art, science and communication. As a result, our projects create new pioneering approaches to communicate with audiences through exhibition spaces, motion pictures, interactive installations, performances and public spaces. kling klang klong is collaborating in this performance with: Annelie Andre, Felipe Duarte Cely, David Fallenbacher, Julien Herion, David Roif and Martine-Nicole Rojina's "Moonbounce" project.
  
  Martine-Nicole Rojina / MPATHY STUDIO collaborated with KLING KLANG KLONG by sharing the recorded phrases of her project Phrases Moon Bounce, sent by different people from different backgrounds. These messages were sent to the moon and received back in collaboration with the Dwingeloo Radio Telescope, HAM Radio Astronomers Jan van Muijlwijk, Harry Keizer and the artistic residency program of CAMRAS. Some of these voices where sent to the moon from a decommissioned Nuclear Reactor during the Music Tech Stockholm 2018.

  [Rainer Kohlberger](http://kohlberger.net) is an Austrian born freelance visual artist / film maker living in Berlin. His work is primarily based on algorithmic compositions with reductionistic aesthetics influenced by flatness, drones and interference. Within his works there always lies a layer of noise, that fascinates him as a sense of the infinite, which is both the ultimate abstraction and inveterately fuzzy. In his films, installations and live performances maximum forms of intensities come into play. His work has won several prizes internationally.
