intro: |
  Radical Ecologies is a critical thinking workshops by Radical spaces Laboratory that aims to reimagine the composition of our inhabited space and its relationships and interactions. How can design engage with this complex space in meaningful ways? How can we experiment with new strategies, systems, technologies, topologies and politics creating new ways of experiencing?What types of tools can we employ to engage with these systems of scale the the environments they produce?
  
  The workshop will use methods from systems analysis, critical thinking and speculative design to deconstruct and reimagine complex environments, investigating system layers and co-designing responses. Participants will explore system topologies, discuss and map the different actors, creating experimental narratives and prototyping artifacts/scenarios that explore new relationships and connections.

  Radical Spaces Laboratory is a participatory design project that aims to deliver community based workshops on how design can be used for transformative thinking. Participants prototype new cultural experiences that explore the reconceptualisation of normative systems in economic, political, cultural and geographic landscapes.
