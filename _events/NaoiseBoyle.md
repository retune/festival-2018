intro: |
  Radical Ecologies is a critical thinking workshops by Radical spaces Laboratory that aims to reimagine the composition of our inhabited space and its relationships and interactions. How can design engage with this complex space in meaningful ways? How can we experiment with new strategies, systems, technologies, topologies and politics creating new ways of experiencing? What types of tools can we employ to deal with systems of scale? Drawing from methods of speculation, critical thinking and experimentalism we will investigate these layers and co-create responses. Participants will explore topologies, discuss and map the different actors that are at play, creating experimental narratives and prototyping artifacts/scenarios that explore new relationships and connections.

  Setting up an independent design research practice that engages with communities and technology in experimental ways.
  The project: Radical Spaces Laboratory is a participatory design project that aims to create community based projects on how design can be used for transformative thinking. Participants prototype new cultural experiences that explore the reconceptualisation of normative systems in economic, political, geographic and sociocultural landscapes.
