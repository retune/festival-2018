intro: |
  The installation »timeline« by Studio RLON at Silent Green plays with our perception of time and space. An endless string is spanned on several pulleys across the cupola of the former crematorium. Two parts of the rope are black, the rest is white. A motor keeps the string in constant movement, causing the black parts of the string to continuously cross the room like a ray of light.
  The length of each black part is exactly one second. While passing through long distances as a straight line, the seconds appears to be slow and content. Other passages require quick shifts of direction and the perception changes to fast and sudden movements.

outro: |
  Studio RLON creates objects and installations characterized by minimal aesthetics, playful interactions and poetic motions. Their works arise out of an particular interest in meta physics, spatial cognition and experiments with materials and processes.

  As children of a rising global consciousness, the three founders understand design as one way to widen our imagination of the future and to encourage individual and confident constructions of realities: «the future is less a shadow of yesterday than a reflection of now. what we think, is what we get. so let us think sassy, brave and juicy. let us connect the dots not straight but curved. we believe we can contribute to such a liquid thinking, by crafting interactions and narrating stories that trigger awareness and reward curiosity with the tools of design and the soul of art».
