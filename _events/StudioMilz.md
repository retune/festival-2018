intro: |
  In this hands-on workshop you will construct a collaborative wood sculpture with the Joyn Machine – an interactive tool that enables the design of wooden framework constructions and their semi-automated production.
  The underlying principle is smart simplification of otherwise complex processes - thereby taking mobile and fast production processes of wooden structures to the next level.

  After a short introduction to our project we will design, produce and build simple constructions on site for the Retune Closing night to launch a spatial experiment.

  Studio Milz values the elegant combination of design, art and science. They love to work on imaginative ideas which merge the digital and physical world and require an interdisciplinary path. By using the contrast of low and high-tech they are establishing a unique vision of communication in three dimensional space. The working process combines specialists in multiple disciplines like communication and interaction design, software and interface design, rapid manufacturing, physical and electronic engineering. Using this creative skill set, Studio Milz has gained a deep understanding of developing bespoke projects. They envision, design and produce.

You will work with wood so it will get a bit loud and dirty - but there are absolutely no woodworking skills required.
If you want to take part in digital designing and modifying the construction you'll need basic skills in CAD.
Bring your Laptop and any CAD-Software - specialized software tools are not required. Special thanks to Futurium for supporting the workshop.
