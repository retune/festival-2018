intro: |
  From Adam Greenfield’s “Radical Technologies” to James Bridle’s “New Dark Age” – the makers of HOLO, a periodical on art, science, and technology, provide festival context with select printed matter and current ‘further reading’ favourites. Special guest: design fiction connoisseurs N O R M A L S will be on site to AxiDraw sardonic techno-futures.

  Alexander Scholz is a Berlin-based writer, art director, and curator interested in interdisciplinary practice, artistic research, and how tools and technologies inform creative processes. He is the founder and creative director of HOLO, a periodical about emerging trajectories in art, science, and technology, and contributing editor at CreativeApplications.Net, the associated online resource on digital art and design. Beyond producing content within editorial frameworks, Alexander has developed a variety of programming for festivals such as ACT (Gwangju), Mapping (Geneva), MUTEK (Montréal), Resonate (Belgrade), and OFFF (Barcelona).
