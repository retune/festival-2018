intro: |
  Synthesis Gallery, the first VR art gallery, is happy to announce its upcoming show ‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to break it’ by Lauren Moffatt curated by Saki Hibino and Giorgio Vitale, as part of Berlin Art Week and Retune Festival 2018.

  The exhibition will feature a mix of paintings and a VR artwork (the two are strictly interwoven: parts of the paintings have been digitally scanned and transported into the Virtual Reality environment), raising provocative questions about materiality and preservation of objects and ideas in connection to the virtual.

  Lauren Moffatt is an Australian artist working between video, performance and immersive technologies. Her works have been screened and exhibited most recently at Palais de Tokyo (FR), Villa Medici (IT), UNSW Galleries (AU), Daegu Art Museum (KOR), Museum Dr. Guislain (BE), SAVVY Contemporary (DE), FACT Liverpool (UK), the Werkleitz Festival (DE), the Sundance Film Festival (US) and at the ZKM (DE).
  Synthesis Gallery is an immersive blend of technology and art displayed under one roof, showcasing cutting-edge experiences by new wave artists and visionaries through virtual reality. We are a space to experience and experiment with the state between dream and reality. Pieces are displayed through different media. Tangible and traditional artforms intermingle with Oculus and Hive headsets. Submerge into the unchartered. Focus on the abstract. Reevaluate reality.
