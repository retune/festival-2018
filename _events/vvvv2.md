intro: |
  In this 3h hands-on workshop, the makers of vvvv, will introduce you to their new visual programming language VL, which they've been working on for the past years. It is targeted at artists, designers and programmers who prefer a more visual approach to programming. 

  They'll show you how, with just a few clicks, to create complex, interactive graphics and save snapshots as a .pdf without writing a single line of code. Or how to achieve advanced computer-vision tasks, like face-tracking, again within just a few minutes of using VL. 

outro:
  While being easy on beginners, VL is also targeted at developers: It essentially combines the advantages of dataflow and object-oriented programming in one visual environment. It builds to the .NET intermediate language and supports features like classes, generics, delegates, async tasks and more. Being compatible with .NET also means that it allows to access any thirdparty .NET library in a drag-and-drop fashion. VL is still in an technology-preview stage at this point and they're looking forward to participants feedback.
