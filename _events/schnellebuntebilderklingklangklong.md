intro: |
  Schnellebuntebilder will setup a little VR-Playground, where you can dive into huge virtual caves or perceive the world like a fish. Plus they're gonna show you some insights of they're latest and not yet released projects. And if you are lucky, you can see some schnellebuntebilders in their natural habitat.

  Their direct neighbor Kling klang klong will open doors to give you a glimpse on what they’ve been doing lately. There will be piano pieces interpreting the flow of rivers, composed by a learning machine. Plus examples of intelligent playback systems, generative sound production and all kinds of insight on their latest audio projects.

outro: |
  Founded in 2011, schnellebuntebilder is a collaboration between Johannes Timpernagel, Robert Pohle, Sebastian Huber, Michael Burk, Ann-Katrin Krenz and Felix Worseck to develop and create multimedia design and digital art.

  schnellebuntebilder work with curators, agents, musicians and artists to create animated explainer films, generative visualizations, audiovisual performances, immersive installations and interactive exhibits.

  schnellebuntebilder always put humans at the center of our work: How can we transmit knowledge to them? How can we lead them by the hand and guide them through complex themes and exhibits? How can we use technology to reach humans on an emotional level?

  Kling klang klong play music and design spaces with their heads, hands and hearts. Their work stands in the intersection of art, science and communication. As a result their projects pioneer in communicating with audiences through exhibition spaces, motion pictures, interactive installations, performances and public spaces.
