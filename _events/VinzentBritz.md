intro: |
  The panel »Visual Communication for an Invisible World« is about finding ways to design for the digital world. Visualising things that are invisible (e.g. code) will become more and more a task designers have to tackle. What does a blockchain look like? How to visualise the smartness of a device or technology? Will AI and machine learning change the design of the future? A panel discussion about possible strategies and ideas from the fields of coding, design and semiotics.
